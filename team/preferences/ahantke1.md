# Preferences for _yournamehere_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail, or something else?  What hours?__ 
    Text, email, discord and slack are all great ways to reach me. I need to check my email and discord for work a few times a day anyway, so its likely I will respond on those.
    However, there are times while I am at work that I will not check either because I am focused, and you may have to text/call the reach me.
    
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
     I don't really have high expectations, but I do expect that we are able to work together effectively and that we are able to complete a majority of assigned tasks.
     
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
     I would like to improve working on a code base with others-- which means writing clean and legible code that everyone in the group can understand.
     
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
     I think its going to be hard at the start to adapt to everones different strategies, but once we learn eachothers habits I think it will be much easier to understand
     why someone is writing code in a certain way or communicating in a certain way.
     
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
     I think that while in some cases you can push people to do more, often times it results in making things more messy and in somecases worse off. I think people who want an
     'A' are probably too focused on the grade anmyway, when its the learning that it far mroe important.
     
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
     Of course, I would never want to hinder anyone else's work.
    
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
     I think everyone should at least do something everyday, whether small or big, so that way no one falls out of the loop and everyone is engaged with whats going on week to week. I don't want to 
     force anyone in a time commitment that they can't do.
     
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
     Based on what people want to take on, skill level, and the needs of the project.
     
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
     Then they get a bad teamwork score?
     
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
     We need to decide if it is worth spending extra time to hammer out better quality. This could also be a chance for the 'A' kids to show that above and beyond mentality.
     
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
     I hate this question. Mostly because the word 'deal' implies a negative context, as if someones work is a burden. I think if we take the time to understand eachothers work
     habbits through empathy we will not have the 'deal' with a team member.
     
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
     I think it would certainly help. Especailly on sprints/weeks where a preticularly hard feature is being implemented.
     
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
     1-2 times a week MAX.
     
1. __Will you need the approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
     I think any decision that effects the group should be agreed upon by the group.
     
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
     Take into concideration why they don't agree and work to compromise. But I am a believer in majority rules.
     
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
     Donno what this is implying but just reach out to them with concerns?
     
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
     I am cool with that but I think an open conversation about splittiing the work should happen.
