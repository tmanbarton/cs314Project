# Preferences for Tyler

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text, email, discord, slack are all good ways to reach me. I won't respond earlier than 8:00 and later than 10:30
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect us to figure out how to work as a team and make an awesome project. I would also like us to do some stuff outside of this project to get to know each other as people instead of just members of a school project team.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I would like to get better at asking for help. I've also not had the chance to offer help in a team setting, so I'll try to do that well.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Different working and styles and personalities might conflict. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Agree to disagree and go for a C :) Actually, maybe we can come to a compromise and say a high B/low A is acceptable yet still aim for an A.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Sure, as long as they don't do so much more that they wind up doing other people's work.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * It's hard to say until it gets started, but it depends on the person I think. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Who has the least to do coming up and who is the most comfortable/with what needs to be done.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Discuss why to try to avoid it happening again in the future. If it keeps happening, go to Dave.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Understand everyone's perspective, find neutral ground, and decide how to improve
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Communicate communicate communicate. Understanding each others' work habits will help us be able to navigate around the differences.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes. ANy time outside of the class will be helpful.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least once a week though I'd prefer more.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Depends on the decision but if involves the whole team everyone's input is necessary.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Find a comprimize, or if none can be made whatever it is probably isn't going to happen.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * He might just need reminding that we are doing this as a team, so I'd respectfully do that
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Ask for others' input and/or specifically start to ask for other people to facilitate.
