# Preferences for Amir Raissi

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail, or something else? What hours?__ 
   * Slack will be the best way to reach me. I do not have notifications turned on for Discord or my school MS Teams.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that the team will be able to at least meet expectations this semster.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My goals are to make sure that everyone is included and contributing to the project.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I would say one of the biggest challeneges we may face is lack of communication which could hinder our preformance. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I would ask the people who want to get an "A" what they think we need to do to achieve that grade and evaluate if meeting that goal is fesiable. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * We should all be doing the same agreed apon work, but if someone wants to go above and beyond that work it is their choice.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I believe that we should be spending at least 8-10 hours a week on this project.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We will assign tickets and tasks based on each persons intrests/abilities.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * That person will need to be talked to and understand they are letting their team down.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I think taking feedback is something that we all need to do, we are trying to get better.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I feel like as long as we are getting the tasks done on the agreed apon dates (not the night before), there shouldn't be anyone having to "deal" with someone's work habits.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think that having a 15 minute stand-up meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays would be beneficial to making sure everyone is on task and nobody is getting left behind. We could do these meetings on Discord as it may be easier to coordinate around everyone's schedule.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * 1-2 a week.
1. __Will you need the approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think this really depends on the decision being made. For group meeting times, absolutely we should make sure everyone agrees and can make it, but with task specific decisions I think it's unreasonable to get every team member's input and honestly could slow production. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * I would definitely hear that one group member out and try to understand why they don't agree. After hearing their reasoning if majority still does not agree with that person, majority rules.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I would let that person know they are dominating the team process and remind them that this is a team.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Personally I am totally fine with most of the facilitation responsibilities falling on me, but for this class I believe the goal is to have the facilitation responsibilities to fall on everyone so I would discuss with my team ways to improve.
