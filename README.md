## Team Preferences

### Communcation
The best way to reach a team member is through either Slack or Discord. Teams, texting, and emailing work for some group members but not all, so be sure to check with that individual before texting/emailing them. Teams should be used for video/audio communication. While it is still possible to share resources, questions, ect. on Teams, Slack and Discord are prefered as team members are not expected to regularly check Teams. The best times to reach team members are standard working hours 8am-6pm. Afterwards, some group members may still respond but sendees should not expect after hours responses in a timely matter.

### Organization
The team will have recurring standups on Tuesdays at 12:20pm, and they will be lead by the SCRUM master. These will be through MS Teams. For members who have emergencies or are unable to make the meetings, they should first notify the group before the time of the meeting. Group meetings are summarized and pinned in the Slack channel for those who could not attend. This will also help the team to recall previous meeting information. As needed additional standups can occur during the week via slack, as team members have conflicting schedules.

### Expectations
Each member of the team will be accountable for the tasks they are assigned. This means each team member is expected to have all assigned tasks completed and up to standard within the given timeframe according to the Zenhub storyboard. It is expected that a new branch will be created with every new fix or feature. Each branch will be approved by at least one other team member in order to avoid conflicts. Branches must include the name of the team member and the issue it will address. It is expected that team members will coordinate through Slack in order to review and commit new code. If a team member is unsure exactly what is expected of them, they should reach out to the team via Slack, Teams, Discord or any other reasonable means of communication.

### Dealing with Adversity
As a team we are committed to communicating in a manner that is respectful at all times and addresses adversity in a way that does not include personal blame, judgement, or destructive criticism. Overall, open communcation is needed in order for the team to preform its best. This may include having conversations with team members about their work and preformance. It is important to understand that team members should not take this feedback personally. If the circumstance presents itself where a team member feels personally attacked they should discuss with the group their perspective on the situation, so that as a group a resolution can be determined. If unable to resolve within the group the team member should share their concerns with Dave/Tas. In the situation where a deadlock occurs or if one team member disagrees with the rest, the team should work towards a comprimise with full consideration of both sides. After attempting first to compromise, the team will make a majority decision. 

### Accountability
In terms of accountability the team recognizes that this class requires a group effort and every member must contribute to the project. In order to keep group members accountable clear expectations are set during the sprint planning process. Each group member will know exactly what is expected from their contribution to the overall project. In addition to verbally communicating these expectations, the expectations are written down and posted in the Team Slack Channel. If a group member does not believe that they are able to meet these expectations they must communicate that with the rest of the team. The group will also maintain open and close communication with one another to make sure all is going to plan and no group member is struggling or encountering problems. If a team member fails to follow through with their commitment to the team, the team will discuss what led to this failure and decide how to proceed in the future.
