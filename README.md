## Team Preferences

### Communcation
The best way to reach a team member is through either Slack or Discord. Teams, texting, and emailing work for some group members but not all, so be sure to check with that individual before texting/emailing them. The best times to reach team members are standard working hours 8am-6pm. Afterwards, some group members may still respond but sendees should not expect after hours responses in a timely matter. The team will have recurring standups on Tuesdays at 12:20pm. These will be through MS Teams. For members who have emergencies or are unable to make the meetings someone (the SCRUM master if they are present) will post a summary to slack. This will also help the team to recall previous meeting information. Outside of that, when needed additional standups can occur during the week via slack, as team members have conflicting schedules. Overall, open communcation is needed in order for the team to preform its best. This may include having conversations with team members about their work and preformance. It is important to understand that team members should not take this feedback personally. If the circumstance presents itself where a team member feels personally attacked they should: bring it up with the group. If unable to resolve within the group: bring it up to Dave/TAs. In the situation where a deadlock occurs or if one team member disagrees with the rest, the team should work towards a comprimise with full consideration of both sides. After attempting first to compromise, the team will make a majority decision.
