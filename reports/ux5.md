### Post Tasks Questions

| Pseudonym | Was it easy to complete all the tasks? If not, why? | How does this compare to other trip planning applications? |   Would you use this application to plan your next trip? Why/why not?   | Is there anything you would change about the application? |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: |
| Sarah     | Yes                                                 |               simplier however more limited                | Easy to use, _really liked_ the expandable information about each place |                       The colors 😬                       |
| Shana     | Yes | Easy to use after playing with application but save/load trips was confusing. | Probably not, would like to have an account or a better way to keep track of old trips.  |   The save/load mechanism  |
| Ben | Yes | Easy to use once they understood the purpose, after 2 minutes the user understood the application well | User would use if they just wanted to gather information on distances as an initial planning tool | User would change how the application manages saving/loading, they recomended just having 2 save/load trip buttons rather than one manage button. |
| Sam | Yes | Interface is simpler compared to other sites | Maybe. Liked the total distance calculation as we drag and drop different destinations | Move the markers to center while selecting each destination |
| Scotty | Yes | Simple compared to other sites. Took a little playing with to get it figured out, but was easy after that. | Probably not. Would be useful for looking up places, but since it doesn't have a ton of features for actually planning it might not great for planning a trip. | Finding where to add random places was a little tricky and move the marker more into view/to the center when selecting and searching for a place. |
