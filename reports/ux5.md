| Sarah     | Yes                                                 |               simplier however more limited                | Easy to use, _really liked_ the expandable information about each place |                       The colors ðŸ˜¬                       |
| Shana     | Yes | Easy to use after playing with application but save/load trips was confusing. | Probably not, would like to have an account or a better way to keep track of old trips.  |   The save/load mechanism  |
| Ben | Yes | Easy to use once they understood the purpose, after 2 minutes the user understood the application well | User would use if they just wanted to gather information on distances as an initial planning tool | User would change how the application manages saving/loading, they recomended just having 2 save/load trip buttons rather than one manage button. |
